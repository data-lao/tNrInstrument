# tNrInstrument

The total reactive nitrogen instrument was developed by the VandenBoer research group and funded by the Sloan foundation. 
The goal of this instrument is to perform modulated measurements and quantify three nitrogenous species to understand our indoor air quality. 

A custom SCADA system written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) is provided here. 

A custom R-script is provided to speed up the data processing and finalization for visualizations and interpretation. 

For full details, please see our published tNr Instrument description paper (in progress, link to be updated).
